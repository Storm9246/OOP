/*
A cityâ€™s Traffic Control Authority wants to implement an automated fine management system to track traffic violations and calculate penalties based on the type of vehicle.
The system should differentiate between cars, bikes, and trucks, applying different fine structures for violations.

Problem Statement:
The system should categorize vehicles into three types:
1. Cars
 - Speed Limit: 80 km/h
 - Fine Rate: $5 per km/h over the limit
 - Additional Fine: If speed exceeds 120 km/h, impose a 10% surcharge
2. Bikes
 - Speed Limit: 60 km/h
 - Fine Rate: $3 per km/h over the limit
 - Additional Fine: If speed exceeds 90 km/h, impose a 15% surcharge
3. Trucks
 - Speed Limit: 70 km/h
 - Fine Rate: $7 per km/h over the limit
 - Additional Fine: If speed exceeds 100 km/h, impose a 20% surcharge

The system should:
--> Allow vehicle registration (Owner Name, Vehicle ID, Vehicle Type).
--> Record a speed violation (input actual speed).
--> Calculate the total fine based on the vehicle type and excess speed.
--> Apply additional surcharge for extreme overspeeding.
--> Display violation details and the fine amount.

Implementation Requirements:
--> Create a base class Vehicle with common attributes: ownerName, vehicleID, speed.
--> Derive three classes: Car, Bike, and Truck from Vehicle.
--> Each derived class should override a method to calculateFine(), applying specific fine rates and surcharges.
--> Implement a user interface in main() to allow entering vehicle details, recording violations, and displaying fine details.
